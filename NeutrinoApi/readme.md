## Obtaining Credentials
### Neutrino side
From the [main account page](https://www.neutrinoapi.com/account/main/), you can grab the User Id and Root Key.
For more keys, please visit the [API Keys page](https://www.neutrinoapi.com/account/keys/), to add or revoke API Keys.

### Custom connector side
Once you are configuring the connector on the Power Platform.

The API requires two parameters sent to the header in order to authenticate the user.
As of today, a custom connector can allow only one parameter at a time.

My decision was then to : 

* You will have to use the **API Key** in order to validate the security stage in the process.
* You will have to pass the **User Id** as parameter to each actions.

Some actions in the connector actions have a "(premium)" info, this means that with the Free tier of the API, you won't be able to use this particular action.
